So after been let down but yet another start up I have to find another Job and honestly its been a bitter sweet experience 

**Things i enjoy about Job Searching**
- Well most at times when you start searching for Jobs you realize how shitty your previous job was the perks that comes with certain jobs I've applied for is unreal
- **The mystery;** for some reason now I've been more open with uncertainty 
- **new experiences and People i get to talk to;** so I've gotten to talk to a few very cool individuals and well it feels good to talk to someone that sees life differently than you
**Things i dislike about job searching**
- well for starters some companies never write back the sorta just leave you to realize that you were not considered 
- **The anxiety;** This i am working on but yeah meetings are not my favourite thing although i know the are necessary, when searching for Jobs you occasionally find interviewers that are so cool your mind feels at ease but most at times that isn't the case ... trust me
