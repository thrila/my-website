So today i tried to do push ups and i could only do 13 in one sitting it sucked i know i shouldn't but i compared it to the global average and it was 35 for men keep in mind that i am not fat and i do not do drugs after a bit of research i decided that i will be doing push ups 
- In the morning before i go to help my parents in shop 
- In the evening before i shower
I know this isn't much but it is a start
Also today i had task from a job i was applying for and it required Data Structures and Algorithm (a tree Data Structure to be precise)
and i couldn't do it. it Sucked well I've also decided to Learn DSA and improve my problem solving skills by;
- Dedicating an Hour to Learning the concepts 
- Practicing DSA (actually writing code) for another hour 
One thing i realized yesterday is that Exercise is good for Learning after i exercise i usually have less mental fog so ill definitely capitalize on that another thing I'm working to change is having an excuse for not doing what i should be doing.
